# NoteVault
This is a simple note app used to create, edit and delete notes once the user logins in.
The frontend ui part is done using React.js using tailwind CSS for styling. And it is hosted using firebase.
The backend is done using express.js with the database store in mongodb and hosted using render.

since i had done a seperate git repo for server you will have to copy paste the server file first to the mail repo and the run the code.

# how to run

npm install

# client side
cd client

npm run dev

# server side
cd server

npm i

npm start
